## About

This project was an oppertunity for me to practice aysnc/await functions to handle third-party APIs. All the data being fetched is from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). Not only did I get to practice my JavaScript skills on this, but I also became more familiar working with Webpack and NPM. Going through OpenWeather's documentation and uncovering all the API's services was another cool learning experience. Still have a lot to learn with Webpack so if you see areas I can improve on, feel free to reach out to me.
